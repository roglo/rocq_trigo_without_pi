synopsis: "A Rocq library for trigonometry based on unit vectors"
description: """
This library formalizes a geometric approach to trigonometry in Coq,
where angles are represented by unit vectors (pairs of real numbers
(x, y) such that x² + y² = 1), instead of real-number angle measures
involving π.

It provides definitions and lemmas for sine, cosine, and angle
addition and division by natural without referring to transcendental
constants, suitable for constructive reasoning and algebraic geometry.
