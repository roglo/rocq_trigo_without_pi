# rocq_trigo_without_pi

A Rocq/Coq library for **trigonometry without Ï€**.

This library defines a form of trigonometry where **angles are not
real numbers**, but instead are represented as **pairs of real numbers
(x, y)** constrained by the unit circle equation xÂ²+yÂ²=1.

This approach is purely geometric and avoids relying on Ï€ as a
fundamental constant, aligning with constructive and algebraic
perspectives.
